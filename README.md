NOTE:

THIS WAS A BEGINNER PROJECT MADE BY ME USING THE RAYLIB GAME LIBRARY IN C

IF YOU WANT TO TRY RAYLIB YOURSELF YOU CAN GO TO THE RAYLIB WEBSITE AT raylib.com  

IF YOU ARE ON A CHROMEBOOK (WITH CROSTINI) OR LINUX SYSTEM YOU CAN USE THE TERMINAL TO DOWNLOAD. ASK YOUR AI ASSISTANT BECAUSE ITS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON DISTRO. 
YOU ALSO CAN DIRECTLY CLONE THE REPO FOR RAYLIB AND DOWNLOAD THE FILES USING SUDO MAKE INSTALL. (OR THATS WHAT ITS LIKE FOR ME)

YOU CAN ALSO FIND THE OFFICIAL REPO BY SEARCHING "raylib" AND IT SHOULD SHOW UP, MAKE SURE THE CREATOR IS NAMED "raysan5." IF NOT, YOU ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE OFFICIAL CREATOR.

IF YOU WANNA EDIT THE CODE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD Dino.c AND COMPILE AND RUN IT USING "gcc dino.c -o dino -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11 && ./dino" YOU MUST HAVE THOSE INSTALLED THOUGH. IF YOU WANT JUST THE GAME YOU CAN TAKE THE dino EXECUTABLE
